### Dear {Company_Name}

 We’re reaching out because we’re beginning to offer limited sponsorship opportunities for companies we think would be a good fit for our audience and we would love to have **{Company_Name}** as one of our main sponsors.

 Our team at Hack the Burgh is organising **Scotland’s largest 24-hour hackathon, with over 250 skilled tech developers** from over 30 universities. We are happy to announce that we are coming back with the sixth edition on the **29th of February 2020 to the 1st of March 2020**

Our goal is to give our talented developers a chance to interact with the best companies around Edinburgh and beyond. We would love to partner with you in order to get **{companys_product_or_API}** out in front of the top developers in the country and give them a chance to work on challenges set by {Company_Name} itself, so that they could explore and learn about what you do in a more hands-on manner.

 Thank you for your time and we are looking forward to working with you.

 All the best,

 **{your_FULL_name}**
