            <p >We’re reaching out because we’re beginning to offer limited sponsorship opportunities for companies we think would be a good fit for our audience and we would love to have <b>{Company_Name}</b> as one of our main sponsors.</p>

            <p>Our team at Hack the Burgh is organising <b>Scotland’s largest 24-hour hackathon, with over 250 skilled tech developers</b> from over 30 universities. We are happy to announce that we are coming back with the sixth edition on the <b>29th of February 2020 to the 1st of March 2020</b>.</p>


            <p>Our goal is to give our talented developers a chance to interact with the best companies around Edinburgh and beyond. We would love to partner with you in order to get <b>{companys_product_or_API}</b> out in front of the top developers in the country and give them a chance to work on challenges set by {Company_Name} itself, so that they could explore and learn about what you do in a more hands-on manner. </p>

            <p>Thank you for your time and we are looking forward to working with you.</p>
